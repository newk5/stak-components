The goal behind these components is to provide a collection of self contained components which don't depend on any external dependencies or any other files.
All components are a single javascript file with css already included (default style), but still provide the ability to customize it if need be. To use them, all you
need to do is import the component javascript file in your HTML page and that's it. These components are framework agnostic and should work with any framework you 
choose to use, or without any framework at all. Contributions are welcome, I only ask that no dependencies are introduced and that the components remain 1 file only 
since the main goals here are simplicity and reliance on web standards.
